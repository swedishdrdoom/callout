# Callout 🎤

**Voice-first workout logging for iOS.**

> *A training memory prosthetic that stays silent until something statistically meaningful goes wrong.*

## What is Callout?

Callout is a workout logging app that prioritizes **zero-friction capture** over everything else. No workout builders. No programs. No setup. Just open the app, speak your sets, and lift.

### Core Philosophy

- **Logging is the product.** Insights are a delayed byproduct.
- **Silence is a feature.** No coaching, no "nice job", no noise.
- **Imperfect logs > unlogged sets.** The cost of correction must be lower than the cost of logging.

### Input Modes

1. **Voice shorthand** (primary): "Bench 100 for 5", "Same again", "Plus 2.5"
2. **Single-tap logging** (fallback): For when voice feels awkward

### Target

- iPhone + AirPods
- Whisper API for transcription
- Built for serious lifters who hate friction
